# Phase 3 Requirements
We will be extending the functionality of the notes application by adding a persistence layer to allow users to save notes to a database, organize them into categories, view, and delete them.    
`As a user, I want my notes to be saved in a database so that I can retrieve them later.`  
`As a user, I want to categorize my notes so that I can more easily find them.`  
`As a user, I want to be able to see a list of my notes so that I can manage them.`  
`As a user, I want to be able to delete a note`
